This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.

Project Information
The project is a case study that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

Project Background

Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss
(called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender 
when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed.  
The main objective is to be able to identify these risky loan applicants, 
then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. 
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.   
Perform an analysis to understand the driving factors (or driver variables)
behind loan default, i.e.the variables which are strong indicators of default.  
The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

Project Statement

Find the major driving factors which leads to the defaulted loans which are source of loss for the company.

Data Set
The data set is a csv file with the loan data of the Lending Club.
